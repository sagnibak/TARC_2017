# TARC_2017
This is the official repo for the Campolindo High School Team America Rocketry Challenge team.
First goal: create an arduino program that takes an altitude the user inputs and moves a servo when the target altitude is reached, uses the MPL3115A2 - I2C altimeter.
Second goal: create an android app that lets users enter the altitude they want and send it via bluetooth to the DFRobot Beetle (arduino uno). Also have the arduino send flight data (barometric pressure, peak altitude, peak velocity) to the app via bluetooth.
